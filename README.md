## About Me

I am a Caltech computer scientist with a focus on applied machine learning. My research experience is in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robot learning, specifically deep reinforcement learning and learning from visual demonstrations. My industry experience is in building algorithms and software for large scale data analysis, specifically related to smart environments and Internet of Things.

### Multi Agent Option Learning for Team Planning
This ongoing research is advised by Professor Yisong Yue at Caltech and in collaboration with Stephan Zheng and Anshul Ramachandran. We aim to use reinforcement learning to learn the team coordination and planning that we see basketball and soccer teams exhibit. Specifically, we employ Multi-Agent Deep Determenistic Policy Gradients with unsupervised option learning in the RoboCup Half Field Offense Simulation environment. We hope to submit this to either ICML 2018 or NIPS 2018.

### Grounded Neural Program Generation
This ongoing research is advised by Professor Silvio Savarese and Professor Fei-Fei Li at Stanford and in collaboration with De-An Huang, Animesh Garg, and Danfei Xu. We aim to tackle one shot visual imitation learning, but doing so while enforcing an internal task representation. More generally, we want to be able to go from a single demonstration of an unseen task to some representation of the task, then build a policy conditioned on the representation to complete the task. We hope to submit this to RSS 2018 or ECCV 2018. 

### Neural Task Programming
This project was advised by Professor Silvio Savarese and Professor Fei-Fei Li at Stanford and in collaboration with Danfei Xu, Animesh Garg, Yuke Zhu, and Julian Gao. We aim to tackle generalization in imitation learning, where given some domain knowledge in a type of task, one can learn a policy to execute a new task with just one video demonstration. Specifically, we use a policy instantiated as a Neural Program, conditioned on a video demonstration. This work is under review at ICRA 2018 and appeared as a talk and poster at CoRL 2017.

### Machine Learning: Applying Neural Networks to IoT Use Cases
I moderated a panel at the 2017 Internet of Things Solutions World Congress on machine learning applied to IoT. My fellow panelists included Dr Richard Soley, chairman of the IIC, Dr. Stan Schneider, CEO of RTI, and Dr. Joe Paradiso, Professor at the MIT Media Lab.
